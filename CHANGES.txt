Changes
=======

1.2 (unreleased)
----------------

* Remove the reference to the grok.View permission that is no longer in
  grokcore.security 1.2

* Use the grok.zope.org/releaseinfo information instead of our own
  copy of ``versions.cfg``, for easier maintenance.


1.1 (2009-07-20)
----------------

* Adapted tests to new grokcore.view release: switched from View to CodeView.

* Add grok.View permissions to functional tests (requires grokcore.security
  1.1)

1.0 (2008-11-15)
----------------

* Created ``grokcore.viewlet`` in November 2008 by factoring
  ``zope.viewlet``-based components, grokkers and directives out of
  Grok.
